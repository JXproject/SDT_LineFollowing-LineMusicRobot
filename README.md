# SDT_LineFollowing-LineMusicRobot
Team 'All Software Team' for University of Waterloo Robotic Student Design Team Internal Competition On Line Following &amp; Line Music Robot

# The Goal
The goal of this project is to create a driving music player. The mechanical design of a simple robot
(likely 4 wheeled) will be required to drive accurately in a straight line at various speeds. The electrical
design must be capable of reading and interpreting a colourcoded
strip and playing music based on the
software commands. The software design must follow the strip accurately, process the colours and
output the corresponding tones, and vary the speed based on user input.
This will be a (friendly) competition. Everyone will work in teams of 3 or 4 and will have 5 weeks to
design their robot. The team with the best music output in terms of sound quality, continuity, and
accuracy of tempo will be the winner. Teams will also be required to submit a design proposal at the end
of Week 1, and documentation of all their work by the end of Week 5.
This manual will contain all the knowledge you need to successfully complete this project, but you will
be required to ask questions and do your own research if you want to get an edge in the competition.
This project will be fairly challenge, covering topics often introduced in 3r d year and will demand some
dedication. However, by the end of it, you will have enough experience to make valuable contributions
to the projects going on within the team currently, or start new projects of your own
